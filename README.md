# RockPaperScissor

ODIN Project - PROJECT: ROCK PAPER SCISSORS
<ol>
	<li>Start a new git repo for your project.</li>
	<li>Create a blank HTML document with a script tag. This game is going to be played completely from the console, so don’t worry about putting anything else in there.</li>
	<li>Your game is going to play against the computer, so begin with a function called computerPlay that will randomly return either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’. We’ll use this function in the game to make the computer’s play.</li>
	<li>4. Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. The function should take two parameters - the playerSelection and computerSelection - and then return a string that declares the winner of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"</li>
	
<ol type="a"><li>make your function case insensitive (so users can input rock, ROCK, RocK or any other variation)</li>

<li>Important note: you want to return the results of this function call, not console.log() them. To test this function console.log the results:</li>
<pre><code>
function playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection) {
	// your code here!
}

const playerSelection = 'rock'
const computerSelection = computerPlay()
console.log(playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection))
​
</pre></code>

</ol>

<li>Write a NEW function called game(). Use the previous function inside of this one to play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end.</li>

<ol type="a"><li>At this point you should still just be using console.log() to display the results of each round and the winner at the end.</li>
	
<li> Use prompt() to get input from the user. Read the docs here if you need to.</li>
<li> Feel free to re-work your previous functions if you need to. Specifically, you might want to change the return value to something more useful.</li>
<li> Feel free to create more “helper” functions if you think it would be useful.</li></ol></ol>
